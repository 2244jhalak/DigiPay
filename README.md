## üìå Project Overview

**DigiPay** is a modern, responsive, and role-based client application for the DigiPay digital wallet system, similar to popular digital wallets like Bkash or Nagad.  

This frontend is built using **React (Vite)**, **TypeScript**, **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It communicates seamlessly with the backend API to provide a secure, fast, and user-friendly experience for **Admins**, **Agents**, and **Users**.  

The application allows users to manage their wallets, view transaction history, and perform financial operations such as sending money, withdrawing, and cashing in/out (for Agents). Admins can manage users, approve or suspend agents, view all transactions, and block/unblock wallets.
